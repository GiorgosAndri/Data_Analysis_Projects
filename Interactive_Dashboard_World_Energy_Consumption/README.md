# World energy consumption interacrive dashboard

This is an interactive dashboard where we can see how the energy consumption types have changed through the years using pandas, numpy, panel and hvplot. 
For a more clear view, download the code and the data and use a Jupyter Notebook.


When you reach the dashboards, use the pipeline buttons because they are more interactive than the dashboards' ones.
